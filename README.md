#  Real-Time Sign Language Recognition System

A real-time American Sign Language (ASL) recognition system built using MediaPipe, TensorFlow, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This project enables the recognition of ASL alphabets from live webcam input using computer vision and deep learning techniques.

##  Features

-  Real-time ASL recognition using webcam
-  Custom CNN model built on top of MobileNetV2
-  MediaPipe for efficient hand tracking
-  Trained on a dataset of 200,000+ labeled ASL alphabet images
-  Supports integration with both local environments and Google Colab
-  High accuracy and smooth performance

## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **MediaPipe**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (for visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook**

##  Dataset

- The dataset contains over **200,000 labeled images** of ASL alphabets.
- Each alphabet class (A-Z) is stored in a separate folder.
- A sample subset for the letter 'A' with 8000 images is available.
